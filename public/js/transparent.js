    // ── Server-rendered element tracking ───────────────────────────────────
    //
    // SPA head/body merging removes elements not present in the new page's
    // HTML response — correct for server-rendered tags (per-page CSS,
    // <meta>, page-specific <script>), but it ALSO nukes anything that a
    // third-party loader injected at runtime: Brevo's chat widget <style>
    // and <div>, Google Analytics tags, Intercom, Crisp, Hotjar, etc.
    // These elements are never in any page's HTML response, so the merge
    // removes them on every nav → user sees the chat widget lose all its
    // CSS and explode to full screen (visible in the user's screenshot of
    // navigating /articles → /).
    //
    // Fix: maintain a WeakSet of elements known to be server-rendered. The
    // initial document's head + body children are server-rendered. Anything
    // we ADD via the SPA merge later is also server-rendered (it came from
    // a server HTML response). Anything else — third-party script
    // injections that happen AFTER snapshot — is never added to the set
    // and is therefore preserved across navs.
    //
    // WeakSet means removed elements get garbage-collected → no leak.
    //
    // MutationObserver auto-tags elements added by ANY route, so even
    // body-script appends or head-script appends elsewhere in this library
    // stay correctly classified.
    // Ported from upstream 1.0.82 — `headlock` design.
    //
    // Replaces the previous hardcoded "never remove SCRIPT/STYLE" rule
    // with a finer-grained API: snapshot the initial head children, then
    // on the next swap, *preserve* anything that's either (a) not in the
    // snapshot (= dynamically injected after load), or (b) matches a
    // configured URL pattern in Settings.headlock, or (c) has a
    // data-headlock attribute (true/non-empty = lock, "false" = unlock).
    //
    // Two key wins over the previous local impl:
    //   1. The previous impl never removed any <script>/<style> at all,
    //      which caused per-page stylesheets to leak across navigations
    //      (e.g. layout1's inline <style> persisting on layout2). The new
    //      design only locks dynamically-injected ones.
    //   2. Project code can pass `headlock: ["brevo.com", "googletag", /hotjar/]`

    //      URLs by substring or regex.
